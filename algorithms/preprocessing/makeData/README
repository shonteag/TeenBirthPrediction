makeData.py
======================

makeData.py is a script used to generate a training and test set from a preprepared single-file dataset. There are a number of techniques for splitting the dataset, and they are detailed in the Options section, under Usage, below.

Usage:
makeData.py [fullFile] [trainFile] [testFile] [options (optional)]

Options:
  --test-size #               The size of the generated testing set (default 300)
  --random                    Will take vectors at random
  --byyear 				      Cuts item by year

USAGE WARNING: [trainFile] and [testFile] are out puts. The script will overwrite anything in these two arguments.
