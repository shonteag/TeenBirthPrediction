normaldata.csv
-> 1112 entries
-> Missing features were imputed using a linear projection model.

nearestneighbordata.csv
-> 1459 entries
-> Missing features were imputed using a linear projection model.
-> Further missing features were filled by using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm.

normaldata_countryholdout_[test/train].csv
